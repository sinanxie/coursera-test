The idea of this assignment is to create a "check off" shopping List application.

Think of being in a store with a shopping list that allows you to "check off" the items you've already bought, except instead of checking them off, the bought item simply moves to the "Already Bought" list.

Your HTML page should display 2 lists, one titled "To Buy" and the other "Already Bought".
